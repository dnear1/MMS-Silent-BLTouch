Monoprice_Maker_select V2 with Creality Silent Board v2.2.1 and BLTouch 3.1

I created this as a safe place to store my TH3D modified firmware to drive my Frankenstein 3d printer, an I3 style Monoprice Maker Select with the Creality Silent board v2.2.1 that uses Trinamic 2208 drivers, and a BLTouch 3.1 probe.

I had to build a new control box from laser cut wood to house the control board, power supply and LCD, since the original box wouldn't fit things without major modifications.
The Creality board didn't work with the Monoprice LCD, so I ended up getting an official Creality LCD board as well.  The BLTouch is mounted using a custom cooling fan housing that I created to improve upon the original Monoprice one that cooled the nozzle too much during printing.
